          <h1>Hi, I'm Gabriel. Nice to meet you</h1>
          <p>I'm a junior front-end developer, and it's been a year and a half that I've been studying front-end development with the goal of finding a job opportunity and getting even more into the development world. I find it amusing to solve code problems and create websites, so I ended up doing some The Odin Project courses, and now I'm focusing on improving my React skills. </p>
